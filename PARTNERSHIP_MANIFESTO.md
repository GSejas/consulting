- Focus on unit economics, not hype
- Create opportunities for drivers, partners, early employees
- Build equity value toward exit or sustainable dividend

---

## Our Operating Philosophy

### **Lean Startup Methodology**
- Test hypotheses before building
- Fail fast, cheap, and smart
- Data-driven decisions (surveys, interviews, financials)
- Validate demand before capital deployment
- Iterate based on customer feedback

### **First Principles Thinking**
- Question assumptions: "Why do we think this will work?"
- Break problems into primitives: "What's the core problem?"
- Rebuild solutions from fundamentals: "What's the minimum viable approach?"
- Challenge status quo: "Is there a better way in Costa Rica specifically?"

### **Execution > Planning**
- Perfect plan never happens
- Done is better than perfect
- Learn by doing, not just thinking
- Measure, adjust, repeat
- Move fast on high-confidence bets

### **Costa Rica First**
- Build for Costa Rican market conditions (labor, regulation, infrastructure)
- Hire locally when possible
- Partner with local businesses & experts
- Reinvest profits into Costa Rican economy
- Understand cultural nuances (business, labor, customer behavior)

---

## Our Operating Principles

### 1. **Data-Driven Everything**
- Decisions backed by research, not gut feel (though gut feel informs research)
- Every business plan has financial model attached
- Every feature has usage metric attached
- Every marketing claim has validation attached

### 2. **Transparent Trade-offs**
- "This is the opportunity cost of that choice"
- "We're betting on X assumption, here's why"
- "If this assumption is wrong, here's the pivot plan"
- "Here's what we're *not* doing and why"

### 3. **Speed + Thoughtfulness**
- Move fast on reversible decisions (design, marketing, small features)
- Move slow on irreversible decisions (company structure, legal, major capital)
- Know which is which

### 4. **Customer-Centric Obsession**
- Interview customers before building (not after)
- Build what solves their pain, not what we think is cool
- Measure success by their satisfaction, not our feature count
- Default to understanding before solving

### 5. **Sustainable Economics**
- Build for profitability from day one (not VC-style cash burn)
- Know unit economics (CAC, LTV, gross margin)
- Build for recurring revenue where possible
- Understand path to 10% net margin minimum

## Decision-Making Framework

### **How We Make Decisions Together**

**Level 1: Routine Decisions** (AI decides, GSejas executes)
- "Write a design spec for this feature"
- "Generate 3 pricing model options"
- "Create a SWOT for this market"
- **Copilot autonomy**: High (provide context, execute fully)

**Level 2: Strategic Decisions** (AI analyzes, GSejas decides)
- "Should we pivot to B2B vs B2C?"
- "Which market should we enter first?"
- "What pricing model maximizes both revenue and fairness?"
- **Copilot autonomy**: Medium (provide research + 2-3 options, GSejas chooses)

**Level 3: Vision Decisions** (GSejas leads, AI supports)
- "Should we keep Water Guy or pivot to Storage Locker?"
- "Should we hire employees or stay solo this year?"
- "What's our long-term exit vision?"
- **Copilot autonomy**: Low (provide data, GSejas decides based on intuition + analysis)

### **Disagreement Protocol**
1. **AI flags concern**: "This assumes X. If X is wrong, the plan fails. Have we validated X?"
2. **GSejas responds**: "Yes, we validated it" OR "You're right, let's test it" OR "I'm willing to take the risk"
3. **Move forward**: Document assumption + validation status ‚Üí proceed

- Guanacaste (Tamarindo, Santa Cruz, etc.) = fastest growing region
- Tech adoption accelerating (mobile payment, gig economy)
- Gap between customer expectations (developed market) and supply (emerging market)

### **Competitive Advantage**
- Local presence + cultural understanding
- Founder with engineering + business skills
- Lean startup approach (test before building huge systems)
- Focus on profitable, sustainable unit economics

### **Vision**
- Make Guanacaste the most tech-enabled tourist destination in Central America
- Build 3-5 profitable platforms serving locals + tourists
- Create jobs + wealth for drivers, partners, team members
- Prove "lean startup" works in emerging markets

### **Ripple Effects**
- Tourists have better experience ‚Üí higher spending ‚Üí repeat visits ‚Üí tax revenue for Costa Rica
- Local businesses more efficient ‚Üí higher profit margins ‚Üí hiring, reinvestment
- Early employees see success ‚Üí stay invested, become founders themselves
- Costa Rica brand strengthened as tech-forward destination

---

## The Audacious Goal

**By Q4 2026**: Build 3 profitable, sustainable platforms in Guanacaste generating $50K+/month combined revenue, employing 20+ people directly, serving 1000+ customers monthly, with clear path to $200K+/month by end of 2027.

**By 2030**: Expand to other regions of Costa Rica, potentially other Central American countries. Create a "platform company" model where GSejas can spin up new verticals efficiently.

**Long-term vision**: Help Costa Rica become a leader in "tech-enabled services for emerging markets" - proving that profitable, sustainable business can be built outside Silicon Valley with deep local roots.

## Failure Modes & How We Avoid Them

### **Failure Mode 1: Running Out of Money**
- *How it happens*: Building without validating demand first
- *How we avoid it*: Lean startup experiments before MVP, focus on unit economics, target profitability early
- *Kill switch*: If no revenue by month 6 of MVP, pivot or pause

### **Failure Mode 2: Building the Wrong Product**
- *How it happens*: Solving our problem, not customers' problem
- *How we avoid it*: Talk to customers first (surveys, interviews), measure adoption, iterate based on feedback
- *Kill switch*: If <50% of users retain after 30 days, pause and research why

### **Failure Mode 3: Founder Burnout**
- *How it happens*: Too many projects, AI dependency, no delegation
- *How we avoid it*: Prioritize ruthlessly, hire early, automate with AI, take breaks
- *Kill switch*: If GSejas reports <5/10 on energy/enthusiasm, pause projects

### **Failure Mode 4: Regulatory/Legal Surprises**
- *How it happens*: Not understanding Costa Rican labor, tax, or sector regulation
- *How we avoid it*: Consult lawyer early, understand constraints before building, build compliance into design
- *Kill switch*: If legal risk is uninsurable/unmitigable, pivot business model

### **Failure Mode 5: Key Person Dependency (GSejas)**
- *How it happens*: AI can't replace founder relationships, decision-making, sales
- *How we avoid it*: Document decision frameworks, train team, delegate earlier than feels comfortable
- *Kill switch*: If GSejas becomes critical path for >50% of revenue, hire operations lead
